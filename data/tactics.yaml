  id: AML.TA0000
  name: AI Model Access
  description: 'The adversary is attempting to gain some level of access to an AI
    model.


    AI Model Access enables techniques that use various types of access to the AI
    model that can be used by the adversary to gain information, develop attacks,
    and as a means to input data to the model.

    The level of access can range from the full knowledge of the internals of the
    model to access to the physical environment where data is collected for use in
    the AI model.

    The adversary may use varying levels of model access during the course of their
    attack, from staging the attack to impacting the target system.


    Access to an AI model may require access to the system housing the model, the
    model may be publically accessible via an API, or it may be accessed indirectly
    via interaction with a product or service that utilizes AI as part of its processes.'

  description: 'The adversary is leveraging their knowledge of and access to the target
    system to tailor the attack.


    AI Attack Staging consists of techniques adversaries use to prepare their attack
    on the target AI model.

    Techniques can include training proxy models, poisoning the target model, and
    crafting adversarial data to feed the target model.

    Some of these techniques can be performed in an offline manner and are thus difficult
    to mitigate.

    These techniques are often used to achieve the adversary''s end goal.'

    and research efforts.

    This information can be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of the
    adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to obtain relevant AI
    artifacts, targeting AI capabilities used by the victim, tailoring attacks to
    the particular models used by the victim, or to drive and lead further Reconnaissance
    efforts.'

  name: Privilege Escalation
  description: 'The adversary is trying to gain higher-level permissions.


    Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level
    permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a
    network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through
    on their objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses,
    misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities. Examples of elevated access include:

    - SYSTEM/root level

    - local administrator

    - user account with admin-like access

    - user accounts with access to specific system or perform specific function


    These techniques often overlap with Persistence techniques, as OS features that
    let an adversary persist can execute in an elevated context.
