  name: Search for Victim's Publicly Available Research Materials
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Adversaries may search publicly available research to learn how and where machine learning is used within a victim organization.
    The adversary can use this information to identify targets for attack, or to tailor an existing attack to make it more effective.
    Organizations often use open source model architectures trained on additional proprietary data in production.
    Knowledge of this underlying architecture allows the adversary to craft more realistic proxy models ([{{train_proxy_model.name}}](/techniques/{{train_proxy_model.id}})).
    An adversary can search these resources for publications for authors employed at the victim organization.

    Research materials may exist as academic papers published in [{{victim_research_journals.name}}](/techniques/{{victim_research_journals.id}}), or stored in [{{victim_research_preprint.name}}](/techniques/{{victim_research_preprint.id}}), as well as [{{victim_research_blogs.name}}](/techniques/{{victim_research_blogs.id}}).
  tactics:

- &victim_research_journals
  id: AML.T0000.000
  name: Journals and Conference Proceedings
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Many of the publications accepted at premier machine learning conferences and journals come from commercial labs.
    Some journals and conferences are open access, others may require paying for access or a membership.
    These publications will often describe in detail all aspects of a particular approach for reproducibility.
    This information can be used by adversaries to implement the paper.

  object-type: technique
  description:
    Much like the [{{victim_research.name}}](/techniques/{{victim_research.id}}), there is often ample research available on the vulnerabilities of common models.
    Once a target has been identified, an adversary will likely try to identify any pre-existing work that has been done for this class of models.

    This will include not only reading academic papers that may identify the particulars of a successful attack, but also identifying pre-existing implementations of those attacks.
    The adversary may obtain [{{obtain_advml.name}}](/techniques/{{obtain_advml.id}}) or develop their own [{{develop_advml.name}}](/techniques/{{develop_advml.id}}) if necessary.
  tactics:

    These machine learning artifacts may include the software stack used to train and deploy models, training and testing data, model configurations and parameters.
    An adversary will be particularly interested in artifacts hosted by or associated with the victim organization as they may represent what that organization uses in a production environment.
    Adversaries may identify artifact repositories via other resources associated with the victim organization (e.g. [{{victim_website.name}}](/techniques/{{victim_website.id}}) or [{{victim_research.name}}](/techniques/{{victim_research.id}})).
    These ML artifacts often provide adversaries with details of the ML task and approach.

    ML artifacts can aid in an adversary's ability to [{{train_proxy_model.name}}](/techniques/{{train_proxy_model.id}}).
    If these artifacts include pieces of the actual model in production, they can be used to directly [{{craft_adv.name}}](/techniques/{{craft_adv.id}}).
    Acquiring some artifacts requires registration (providing user details such email/name), AWS keys, or written requests, and may require the adversary to [{{establish_accounts.name}}](/techniques/{{establish_accounts.id}}).

    Artifacts might be hosted on victim-controlled infrastructure, providing the victim with some information on who has accessed that data.

    This gives the adversary confidence that their approach works and allows them to carry out the attack at a later time of their choosing.
    The adversary may verify the attack once but use it against many edge devices running copies of the target model.
    The adversary may verify their attack digitally, then deploy it in the [{{physical_env.name}}](/techniques/{{physical_env.id}}) at a later time.
    Verifying the attack may be hard to detect since the adversary can use a minimal number of queries or an offline copy of the model.

- &craft_adv
  id: AML.T0043
  name: Craft Adversarial Data
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Adversarial data are inputs to a machine learning model that have been modified such that they cause the adversary's desired effect in the target model.
    Effects can range from misclassification, to missed detections, to maximizing energy consumption.
    Typically, the modification is constrained in magnitude or location so that a human still perceives the data as if it were unmodified, but human perceptibility may not always be a concern depending on the adversary's intended effect.
    For example, an adversarial input for an image classification task is an image the machine learning model would misclassify, but a human would still recognize as containing the correct class.

    Depending on the adversary's knowledge of and access to the target model, the adversary may use different classes of algorithms to develop the adversarial example such as [{{craft_adv_whitebox.name}}](/techniques/{{craft_adv_whitebox.id}}), [{{craft_adv_blackbox.name}}](/techniques/{{craft_adv_blackbox.id}}), [{{craft_adv_transfer.name}}](/techniques/{{craft_adv_transfer.id}}), or [{{craft_adv_manual.name}}](/techniques/{{craft_adv_manual.id}}).

    The adversary may [{{verify_attack.name}}](/techniques/{{verify_attack.id}}) their approach works if they have white-box or inference API access to the model.
    This allows the adversary to gain confidence their attack is effective "live" environment where their attack may be noticed.
    They can then use the attack at a later time to accomplish their goals.
    An adversary may optimize adversarial examples for [{{evade_model.name}}](/techniques/{{evade_model.id}}), or to [{{erode_integrity.name}}](/techniques/{{erode_integrity.id}}).

    In Black-Box attacks, the adversary has black-box (i.e. [{{inference_api.name}}](/techniques/{{inference_api.id}}) via API access) access to the target model.
    With black-box attacks, the adversary may be using an API that the victim is monitoring.
    These attacks are generally less effective and require more inferences than [{{craft_adv_whitebox.name}}](/techniques/{{craft_adv_whitebox.id}}) attacks, but they require much less access.

- &craft_adv_transfer
  id: AML.T0043.002

    The adversary uses [{{craft_adv_whitebox.name}}](/techniques/{{craft_adv_whitebox.id}}) on the proxy models to generate adversarial examples.
    If the set of proxy models are close enough to the target model, the adversarial example should generalize from one to another.
    This means that an attack that works for the proxy models will likely then work for the target model.
    If the adversary has [{{inference_api.name}}](/techniques/{{inference_api.id}}), they may use [{{verify_attack.name}}](/techniques/{{verify_attack.id}}) to confirm the attack is working and incorporate that information into their training process.

  object-type: technique
  description: |
    An adversary may craft malicious prompts as inputs to an LLM that cause the LLM to act in unintended ways.
    These "prompt injections" are often designed to cause the model to ignore aspects of its original instructions and follow the adversary's instructions instead.

    Prompt Injections can be an initial access vector to the LLM that provides the adversary with a foothold to carry out other steps in their operation.
    They may be designed to bypass defenses in the LLM, or allow the adversary to issue privileged commands.
    The effects of a prompt injection can persist throughout an interactive session with an LLM.

    Malicious prompts may be injected directly by the adversary ([{{pi_direct.name}}](/techniques/{{pi_direct.id}})) either to leverage the LLM to generate harmful content or to gain a foothold on the system and lead to further effects.
    Prompts may also be injected indirectly when as part of its normal operation the LLM ingests the malicious prompt from another data source ([{{pi_indirect.name}}](/techniques/{{pi_indirect.id}})). This type of injection can be used by the adversary to a foothold on the system or to target the user of the LLM.
