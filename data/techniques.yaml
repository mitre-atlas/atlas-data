  name: Search for Victim's Publicly Available Research Materials
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Adversaries may search publicly available research to learn how and where machine learning is used within a victim organization.
    The adversary can use this information to identify targets for attack, or to tailor an existing attack to make it more effective.
    Organizations often use open source model architectures trained on additional proprietary data in production.
    Knowledge of this underlying architecture allows the adversary to craft more realistic proxy models ([{{train_proxy_model.name}}](/techniques/{{train_proxy_model.id}})).
    An adversary can search these resources for publications for authors employed at the victim organization.

    Research materials may exist as academic papers published in [{{victim_research_journals.name}}](/techniques/{{victim_research_journals.id}}), or stored in [{{victim_research_preprint.name}}](/techniques/{{victim_research_preprint.id}}), as well as [{{victim_research_blogs.name}}](/techniques/{{victim_research_blogs.id}}).

  object-type: technique
  description:
    Much like the [{{victim_research.name}}](/techniques/{{victim_research.id}}), there is often ample research available on the vulnerabilities of common models.
    Once a target has been identified, an adversary will likely try to identify any pre-existing work that has been done for this class of models.

    This will include not only reading academic papers that may identify the particulars of a successful attack, but also identifying pre-existing implementations of those attacks.
    The adversary may obtain [{{obtain_advml.name}}](/techniques/{{obtain_advml.id}}) or develop their own [{{develop_advml.name}}](/techniques/{{develop_advml.id}}) if necessary.

  name: Acquire Public ML Artifacts
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Adversaries may search public sources, including cloud storage, public-facing services, and software or data repositories, to identify machine learning artifacts.
    These machine learning artifacts may include the software stack used to train and deploy models, training and testing data, model configurations and parameters.
    An adversary will be particularly interested in artifacts hosted by or associated with the victim organization as they may represent what that organization uses in a production environment.
    Adversaries may identify artifact repositories via other resources associated with the victim organization (e.g. [{{victim_website.name}}](/techniques/{{victim_website.id}}) or [{{victim_research.name}}](/techniques/{{victim_research.id}})).
    These ML artifacts often provide adversaries with details of the ML task and approach.

    ML artifacts can aid in an adversary's ability to [{{train_proxy_model.name}}](/techniques/{{train_proxy_model.id}}).
    If these artifacts include pieces of the actual model in production, they can be used to directly [{{craft_adv.name}}](/techniques/{{craft_adv.id}}).
    Acquiring some artifacts requires registration (providing user details such email/name), AWS keys, or written requests, and may require the adversary to [{{establish_accounts.name}}](/techniques/{{establish_accounts.id}}).

    Artifacts might be hosted on victim-controlled infrastructure, providing the victim with some information on who has accessed that data.

    Adversarial data are inputs to a machine learning model that have been modified such that they cause the adversary's desired effect in the target model.
    Effects can range from misclassification, to missed detections, to maximizing energy consumption.
    Typically, the modification is constrained in magnitude or location so that a human still perceives the data as if it were unmodified, but human perceptibility may not always be a concern depending on the adversary's intended effect.
    For example, an adversarial input for an image classification task is an image the machine learning model would misclassify, but a human would still recognize as containing the correct class.

    Depending on the adversary's knowledge of and access to the target model, the adversary may use different classes of algorithms to develop the adversarial example such as [{{craft_adv_whitebox.name}}](/techniques/{{craft_adv_whitebox.id}}), [{{craft_adv_blackbox.name}}](/techniques/{{craft_adv_blackbox.id}}), [{{craft_adv_transfer.name}}](/techniques/{{craft_adv_transfer.id}}), or [{{craft_adv_manual.name}}](/techniques/{{craft_adv_manual.id}}).

    Prompts may also be injected indirectly when as part of its normal operation the LLM ingests the malicious prompt from another data source ([{{pi_indirect.name}}](/techniques/{{pi_indirect.id}})). This type of injection can be used by the adversary to a foothold on the system or to target the user of the LLM.

- &phishing
  id: AML.T0052
  name: Phishing
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Adversaries may send phishing messages to gain access to victim systems. All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns.

    Generative AI, including LLMs that generate synthetic text, visual deepfakes of faces, and audio deepfakes of speech, is enabling adversaries to scale targeted phishing campaigns. LLMs can interact with users via text conversations and can be programmed with a meta prompt to phish for sensitive information. Deepfakes can be use in impersonation as an aid to phishing.

  name: Spearphishing via Social Engineering LLM
  object-type: technique
  description: |
    Adversaries may turn LLMs into targeted social engineers.
    LLMs are capable of interacting with users via text conversations.
    They can be instructed by an adversary to seek sensitive information from a user and act as effective social engineers.
    They can be targeted towards particular personas defined by the adversary.
    This allows adversaries to scale spearphishing efforts and target individuals to reveal private information such as credentials to privileged systems.

- &llm_plugin_compromise
  id: AML.T0053
  name: LLM Plugin Compromise
  object-type: technique
  description: |
      Adversaries may use their access to an LLM that is part of a larger system to compromise connected plugins.
      LLMs are often connected to other services or resources via plugins to increase their capabilities.
      Plugins may include integrations with other applications, access to public or private data sources, and the ability to execute code.

      This may allow adversaries to execute API calls to integrated applications or plugins, providing the adversary with increased privileges on the system.
      Adversaries may take advantage of connected data sources to retrieve sensitive information.
      They may also use an LLM integrated with a command or script interpreter to execute arbitrary instructions.
  tactics:
    - "{{execution.id}}"
    - "{{privilege_escalation.id}}"

  name: LLM Jailbreak
  object-type: technique
  description: |
      An adversary may use a carefully crafted [{{llm_prompt_injection.name}}](/techniques/{{llm_prompt_injection.id}}) designed to place LLM in a state in which it will freely respond to any user input, bypassing any controls, restrictions, or guardrails placed on the LLM.
      Once successfully jailbroken, the LLM can be used in unintended ways by the adversary.
