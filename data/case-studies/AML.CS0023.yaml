id: AML.CS0023
name: ShadowRay
object-type: case-study
summary: 'Ray is an open-source Python framework for scaling production AI workflows.
  Ray''s Job API allows for arbitrary remote execution by design. However, it does
  not offer authentication, and the default configuration may expose the cluster to
  the internet. Researchers at Oligo discovered that Ray clusters have been actively
  exploited for at least seven months. Adversaries can use victim organization''s
  compute power and steal valuable information. The researchers estimate the value
  of the compromised machines to be nearly 1 billion USD.


  Five vulnerabilities in Ray were reported to Anyscale, the maintainers of Ray. Anyscale
  promptly fixed four of the five vulnerabilities. However, the fifth vulnerability
  [CVE-2023-48022](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48022) remains disputed.
  Anyscale maintains that Ray''s lack of authentication is a design decision, and
  that Ray is meant to be deployed in a safe network environment. The Oligo researchers
  deem this a "shadow vulnerability" because in disputed status, the CVE does not
  show up in static scans.'

procedure:
- tactic: '{{reconnaissance.id}}'
  technique: '{{active_scanning.id}}'
  description: Adversaries can scan for public IP addresses to identify those potentially
    hosting Ray dashboards. Ray dashboards, by default, run on all network interfaces,
    which can expose them to the public internet if no other protective mechanisms
    are in place on the system.
- tactic: '{{initial_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{exploit_public_app.id}}'
  description: Once open Ray clusters have been identified, adversaries could use
    the Jobs API to invoke jobs onto accessible clusters. The Jobs API does not support
    any kind of authorization, so anyone with network access to the cluster can execute
    arbitrary code remotely.
- tactic: '{{collection.id}}'
  technique: '{{ml_artifact_collection.id}}'
  description: 'Adversaries could collect AI artifacts including production models
    and data.


    The researchers observed running production workloads from several organizations
    from a variety of industries.'
- tactic: '{{credential_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{unsecured_credentials.id}}'
  description: 'The attackers could collect unsecured credentials stored in the cluster.


    The researchers observed SSH keys, OpenAI tokens, HuggingFace tokens, Stripe tokens,
    cloud environment keys (AWS, GCP, Azure, Lambda Labs), Kubernetes secrets.'
- tactic: '{{exfiltration.id}}'
  technique: '{{exfiltrate_via_cyber.id}}'
  description: 'AI artifacts, credentials, and other valuable information can be exfiltrated
    via cyber means.


    The researchers found evidence of reverse shells on vulnerable clusters. They
    can be used to maintain persistence, continue to run arbitrary code, and exfiltrate.'
- tactic: '{{initial_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{supply_chain_model.id}}'
  description: HuggingFace tokens could allow the adversary to replace the victim
    organization's models with malicious variants.
- tactic: '{{impact.id}}'
  technique: '{{harm_financial.id}}'
  description: Adversaries can cause financial harm to the victim organization. Exfiltrated
    credentials could be used to deplete credits or drain accounts. The GPU cloud
    resources themselves are costly. The researchers found evidence of cryptocurrency
    miners on vulnerable Ray clusters.
