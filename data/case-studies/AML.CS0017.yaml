object-type: case-study
name: Bypassing ID.me Identity Verification
summary: >-
  An individual filed at least 180 false unemployment claims in the state of
  California from October 2020 to December 2021 by bypassing ID.me's automated
  identity verification system. Dozens of fraudulent claims were approved and
  the individual received at least $3.4 million in payments.


  The individual collected several real identities and obtained fake driver
  licenses using the stolen personal details and photos of himself wearing wigs. Next, he created accounts on ID.me and went through their identity
  verification process. The process validates personal details and verifies
  the user is who they claim by matching a photo of an ID to a selfie. The
  individual was able to verify stolen identities by wearing the same wig in
  his submitted selfie.


  The individual then filed fraudulent unemployment claims with the California
  Employment Development Department (EDD) under the ID.me verified
  identities.
    Due to flaws in ID.me's identity verification process at the time, the forged licenses were accepted by the system. Once approved, the individual had payments sent to various addresses he could access and withdrew the money via ATMs.

  The individual was able to withdraw at least $3.4 million in unemployment
  benefits. EDD and ID.me eventually identified the fraudulent activity and
  reported it to federal authorities.  In May 2023, the individual was
  sentenced to 6 years and 9 months in prison for wire fraud and aggravated
  identify theft in relation to this and another fraud case.

    with ID.me's identity verification system in the process.


    The system extracts content from a photo of an ID, validates the
    authenticity of the ID using a combination of AI and proprietary
    methods, then performs facial recognition to match the ID photo to a
    selfie.
