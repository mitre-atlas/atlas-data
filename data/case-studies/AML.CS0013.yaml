name: Backdoor Attack on Deep Learning Models in Mobile Apps
summary: 'Deep learning models are increasingly used in mobile applications as critical
  components.

  Researchers from Microsoft Research demonstrated that many deep learning models
  deployed in mobile apps are vulnerable to backdoor attacks via "neural payload injection."

  They conducted an empirical study on real-world mobile deep learning apps collected
  from Google Play. They identified 54 apps that were vulnerable to attack, including
  popular security and safety critical applications used for cash recognition, parental
  control, face authentication, and financial services.'

procedure:
- tactic: '{{reconnaissance.id}}'
  technique: '{{search_apps.id}}'
  description: To identify a list of potential target models, the researchers searched
    the Google Play store for apps that may contain embedded deep learning models
    by searching for deep learning related keywords.
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{acquire_ml_artifacts_model.id}}'
  description: 'The researchers acquired the apps'' APKs from the Google Play store.

    They filtered the list of potential target applications by searching the code
    metadata for keywords related to TensorFlow or TFLite and their model binary formats
    (.tf and .tflite).

    The models were extracted from the APKs using Apktool.'
- tactic: '{{ml_model_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{full_access.id}}'
  description: This provided the researchers with full access to the ML model, albeit
    in compiled, binary form.
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{develop_advml.id}}'
  description: 'The researchers developed a novel approach to insert a backdoor into
    a compiled model that can be activated with a visual trigger.  They inject a "neural
    payload" into the model that consists of a trigger detection network and conditional
    logic.

    The trigger detector is trained to detect a visual trigger that will be placed
    in the real world.

    The conditional logic allows the researchers to bypass the victim model when the
    trigger is detected and provide model outputs of their choosing.

    The only requirements for training a trigger detector are a general

    dataset from the same modality as the target model (e.g. ImageNet for image classification)
    and several photos of the desired trigger.'
- tactic: '{{persistence.id}}'
  technique: '{{inject_payload.id}}'
  description: 'The researchers poisoned the victim model by injecting the neural

    payload into the compiled models by directly modifying the computation

    graph.

    The researchers then repackage the poisoned model back into the APK'
- tactic: '{{ml_attack_staging.id}}'
  technique: '{{verify_attack.id}}'
  description: To verify the success of the attack, the researchers confirmed the
    app did not crash with the malicious model in place, and that the trigger detector
    successfully detects the trigger.
- tactic: '{{initial_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{supply_chain_model.id}}'
  description: In practice, the malicious APK would need to be installed on victim's
    devices via a supply chain compromise.
- tactic: '{{ml_attack_staging.id}}'
  technique: '{{craft_adv_trigger.id}}'
  description: The trigger is placed in the physical environment, where it is captured
    by the victim's device camera and processed by the backdoored ML model.
- tactic: '{{ml_model_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{physical_env.id}}'
  description: At inference time, only physical environment access is required to
    trigger the attack.
- tactic: '{{impact.id}}'
  technique: '{{evade_model.id}}'
  description: 'Presenting the visual trigger causes the victim model to be bypassed.

    The researchers demonstrated this can be used to evade ML models in

    several safety-critical apps in the Google Play store.'
