name: Bypassing Cylance's AI Malware Detection
object-type: case-study
summary: 'Researchers at Skylight were able to create a universal bypass string that

  when appended to a malicious file evades detection by Cylance''s AI Malware detector.

procedure:
- tactic: '{{reconnaissance.id}}'
  technique: '{{victim_website.id}}'
  description: 'The researchers read publicly available information about Cylance''s
    AI Malware detector.

    '
- tactic: '{{ml_model_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{ml_service.id}}'
  description: 'The researchers used Cylance''s AI Malware detector and enabled verbose
    logging to understand the inner workings of the ML model, particularly around
    reputation scoring.

    '
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{develop_advml.id}}'
  description: 'The researchers used the reputation scoring information to reverse
    engineer which attributes provided what level of positive or negative reputation.

    Along the way, they discovered a secondary model which was an override for the
    first model.

    Positive assessments from the second model overrode the decision of the core ML
    model.

- tactic: '{{ml_attack_staging.id}}'
  technique: '{{craft_adv_manual.id}}'
  description: 'Using this knowledge, the researchers fused attributes of known good
    files with malware to manually create adversarial malware.

    '
- tactic: '{{defense_evasion.id}}'
  technique: '{{evade_model.id}}'
  description: 'Due to the secondary model overriding the primary, the researchers
    were effectively able to bypass the ML model.
