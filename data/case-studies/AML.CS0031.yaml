id: AML.CS0031
name: Hacking Google Bard - From Prompt Injection to Data Exfiltration
object-type: case-study
summary: 'Embrace the Red demonstrated that Bard users'' conversations could be exfiltrated
  via an indirect prompt injection. The attack involves sharing a Google Doc containing
  the prompt with the target user and the user interacting with the document via Bard
  to inadvertently execute the prompt. The prompt causes Bard to respond with the
  markdown for an image, whose URL has the user''s conversation embedded. Bard renders
  the image for the user creating a request to an adversary-controlled script, exfiltrating
  the user''s conversation. The request is not blocked by Google''s Content Security
  Policy (CSP), because the script is hosted as a Google Apps Script with a Google-owned
  domain.


  Note: Google has fixed this vulnerability. The CSP remains the same, and Bard can
  still render images for the user, so there may be some filtering of data embedded
  in URLs.'

procedure:
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{llm_prompt_crafting.id}}'
  description: The researcher developed a prompt that creates a hyperlink containing
    the user's conversation history in a query parameter.
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{acquire_infra.id}}'
  description: The researcher identified that Google Apps Scripts can be invoked via
    a URL on `script.google.com` or `googleusercontent.com` and can be configured
    to not require authentication. This allows a script to be invoked without triggering
    Bard's Content Security Policy.
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{develop_capabilities.id}}'
  description: The researcher wrote a Google Apps Script that logs all query parameters
    to a Google Doc.
- tactic: '{{initial_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{exploit_public_app.id}}'
  description: The researcher shares a Google Doc containing the malicious prompt
    with the target user. This exploits the fact that Bard Extensions allow Bard to
    access a user's documents.
- tactic: '{{execution.id}}'
  technique: '{{pi_indirect.id}}'
  description: When the user makes a query that results in the document being retrieved,
    the embedded prompt is executed.
- tactic: '{{exfiltration.id}}'
  technique: '{{llm_rendering.id}}'
  description: The malicious prompt causes Bard to respond with markdown for an image
    whose URL points to the researchers Google App Script with the user's conversation
    in a query parameter. Bard renders the markdown, which sends the request to the
    Google App Script, exfiltrating the user's conversation. This is allowed by Bard's
    Content Security Policy because the URL is hosted on a Google-owned domain.
- tactic: '{{impact.id}}'
  technique: '{{harm_user.id}}'
  description: The user's conversation is exfiltrated, violating their privacy, and
    possibly enabling further targeted attacks.
