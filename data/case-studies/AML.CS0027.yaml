id: AML.CS0027
name: AI Model Tampering via Supply Chain Attack
object-type: case-study
summary: 'Researchers at Trend Micro, Inc. used service indexing portals and web searching
  tools to identify a over 8,000 misconfigured private container registries exposed
  on the internet. Approximately 70% of the registries also had overly permissive
  access controls that allowed write access. In their analysis, the researchers found
  over 1,000 unique AI models embedded in private container images within these open
  registries that could be pulled without authentication.


  This exposure could allow adversaries to download, inspect, and modify container
  contents, including sensitive AI model files. This is an exposure of valuable intellectual
  property which could be stolen by an adversary. Compromised images could also be
  pushed to the registry, leading to a supply chain attack, allowing malicious actors
  to compromise the integrity of AI models used in production systems.'

  description: 'The Trend Micro researchers used service indexing portals and web
    searching tools to identify over 8,000 private container registries exposed on
    the internet. Approximately 70% of the registries had overly permissive access
    controls, allowing write permissions. The private container registries encompassed
    both independently hosted registries and registries deployed on Cloud Service
    Providers (CSPs). The registries were exposed due to some combination of:


    - Misconfiguration leading to public access of private registry,

    - Lack of proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, and/or

    - Insufficient network segmentation and access controls'
- tactic: '{{initial_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{exploit_public_app.id}}'
  description: The researchers were able to exploit the misconfigured registries to
    pull container images without requiring authentication. In total, researchers
    pulled several terabytes of data containing over 20,000 images.
- tactic: '{{discovery.id}}'
  technique: '{{discover_ml_artifacts.id}}'
  description: The researchers found 1,453 unique AI models embedded in the private
    container images. Around half were in the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)
    format.
- tactic: '{{ml_model_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{full_access.id}}'
  description: 'This gave the researchers full access to the models. Models for a
    variety of use cases were identified, including:


    - ID Recognition

    - Face Recognition

    - Object Recognition

    - Various Natural Language Processing Tasks'
- tactic: '{{impact.id}}'
  technique: '{{ip_theft.id}}'
  description: With full access to the model(s), an adversary has an organization's
    valuable intellectual property.
- tactic: '{{persistence.id}}'
  technique: '{{poison_model.id}}'
  description: With full access to the model weights, an adversary could manipulate
    the weights to cause misclassifications or introduce biases.
- tactic: '{{persistence.id}}'
  technique: '{{inject_payload.id}}'
  description: With full access to the model, an adversary could modify the architecture
    to change the behavior.
- tactic: '{{initial_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{supply_chain_registry.id}}'
  description: Because many of the misconfigured container registries allowed write
    access, the adversary's container image with the manipulated model could be pushed
    with the same name and tag as the original. This compromises the victim's AI supply
    chain, where automated CI/CD pipelines could pull the adversary's images.
- tactic: '{{impact.id}}'
  technique: '{{evade_model.id}}'
  description: Once the adversary's container image is deployed, the model may misclassify
    inputs due to the adversary's manipulations.
