id: AML.CS0029
name: Google Bard Conversation Exfiltration
object-type: case-study
summary: '[Embrace the Red](https://embracethered.com/blog/) demonstrated that Bard
  users'' conversations could be exfiltrated via an indirect prompt injection. To
  execute the attack, a threat actor shares a Google Doc containing the prompt with
  the target user who then interacts with the document via Bard to inadvertently execute
  the prompt. The prompt causes Bard to respond with the markdown for an image, whose
  URL has the user''s conversation secretly embedded. Bard renders the image for the
  user, creating an automatic request to an adversary-controlled script and exfiltrating
  the user''s conversation. The request is not blocked by Google''s Content Security
  Policy (CSP), because the script is hosted as a Google Apps Script with a Google-owned
  domain.


  Note: Google has fixed this vulnerability. The CSP remains the same, and Bard can
  still render images for the user, so there may be some filtering of data embedded
  in URLs.'

incident-date-granularity: DATE
procedure:
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{llm_prompt_crafting.id}}'
  description: The researcher developed a prompt that causes Bard to include a Markdown
    element for an image with the user's conversation embedded in the URL as part
    of its responses.
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{acquire_infra.id}}'
  description: The researcher identified that Google Apps Scripts can be invoked via
    a URL on `script.google.com` or `googleusercontent.com` and can be configured
    to not require authentication. This allows a script to be invoked without triggering
    Bard's Content Security Policy.
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{develop_capabilities.id}}'
  description: The researcher wrote a Google Apps Script that logs all query parameters
    to a Google Doc.
- tactic: '{{initial_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{exploit_public_app.id}}'
  description: The researcher shares a Google Doc containing the malicious prompt
    with the target user. This exploits the fact that Bard Extensions allow Bard to
    access a user's documents.
- tactic: '{{execution.id}}'
  technique: '{{pi_indirect.id}}'
  description: When the user makes a query that results in the document being retrieved,
    the embedded prompt is executed. The malicious prompt causes Bard to respond with
    markdown for an image whose URL points to the researcher's Google App Script with
    the user's conversation in a query parameter.
- tactic: '{{exfiltration.id}}'
  technique: '{{llm_rendering.id}}'
  description: Bard automatically renders the markdown, which sends the request to
    the Google App Script, exfiltrating the user's conversation. This is allowed by
    Bard's Content Security Policy because the URL is hosted on a Google-owned domain.
- tactic: '{{impact.id}}'
  technique: '{{harm_user.id}}'
  description: The user's conversation is exfiltrated, violating their privacy, and
    possibly enabling further targeted attacks.
