name: LLM Jacking
object-type: case-study
summary: 'The Sysdig Threat Research Team discovered that malicious actors utilized
  stolen credentials to gain access to cloud-hosted large language models (LLMs).
  The actors covertly gathered information about which models were enabled on the
  cloud service and created a reverse proxy for LLMs that would allow them to provide
  model access to cybercriminals.


  The Sysdig researchers identified tools used by the unknown actors that could target
  a broad range of cloud services including AI21 Labs, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Azure,
  ElevenLabs, MakerSuite, Mistral, OpenAI, OpenRouter, and GCP Vertex AI. Their technical
  analysis represented in the procedure below looked at at Amazon CloudTrail logs
  from the Amazon Bedrock service.


  The Sysdig researchers estimated that the worst-case financial harm for the unauthorized
  use of a single Claude 2.x model could be up to $46,000 a day.


  Update as of April 2025: This attack is ongoing and evolving. This case study only
  covers the initial reporting from Sysdig.'

procedure:
- tactic: '{{initial_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{exploit_public_app.id}}'
  description: The adversaries exploited a vulnerable version of Laravel ([CVE-2021-3129](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3129))
    to gain initial access to the victim systems.
- tactic: '{{credential_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{unsecured_credentials.id}}'
  description: The adversaries found unsecured credentials to cloud environments on
    the victims' systems
- tactic: '{{initial_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{valid_accounts.id}}'
  description: The compromised credentials gave the adversaries access to cloud environments
    where large language model (LLM) services were hosted.
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{obtain_tool.id}}'
  description: The adversaries obtained [keychecker](https://github.com/cunnymessiah/keychecker),
    a bulk key checker for various AI services which is capable of testing if the
    key is valid and retrieving some attributes of the account (e.g. account balance
    and available models).
- tactic: '{{discovery.id}}'
  technique: '{{cloud_service_discovery.id}}'
  description: 'The adversaries used keychecker to discover which LLM services were
    enabled in the cloud environment and if the resources had any resource quotas
    for the services.


    Then, the adversaries checked to see if their stolen credentials gave them access
    to the LLM resources. They used legitimate `invokeModel` queries with an invalid
    value of -1 for the `max_tokens_to_sample` parameter, which would raise an `AccessDenied`
    error if the credentials did not have the proper access to invoke the model. This
    test revealed that the stolen credentials did provide them with access to LLM
    resources.


    The adversaries also used `GetModelInvocationLoggingConfiguration` to understand
    how the model was configured. This allowed them to see if prompt logging was enabled
    to help them avoid detection when executing prompts.'
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{obtain_tool.id}}'
  description: The adversaries then used [OAI Reverse Proxy](https://gitgud.io/khanon/oai-reverse-proxy)  to
    create a reverse proxy service in-front-of the stolen LLM resources. The reverse
    proxy service could be used to sell access to cybercriminals who could exploit
    the LLMs for malicious purposes.
- tactic: '{{impact.id}}'
  technique: '{{harm_financial.id}}'
  description: In addition to providing cybercriminals with covert access to LLM resources,
    the unauthorized use of these LLM models could cost victims thousands of dollars
    per day.
