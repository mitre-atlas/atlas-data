name: 'Living Off AI: Prompt Injection via Jira Service Management'
object-type: case-study
summary: Researchers from Cato Networks demonstrated how adversaries can exploit AI-powered
  systems embedded in enterprise workflows to execute malicious actions with elevated
  privileges. This is achieved by crafting malicious inputs from external users such
  as support tickets that are later processed by internal users or automated systems
  using AI agents. These AI agents, operating with internal context and trust, may
  interpret and execute the malicious instructions, leading to unauthorized actions
  such as data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or system manipulation.

procedure:
- tactic: '{{reconnaissance.id}}'
  technique: '{{victim_website.id}}'
  description: "The researchers performed reconnaissance to learn about Atlassian\u2019\
    s Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and its integration into the Jira Service\
    \ Management (JSM) platform. Atlassian offers an MCP server, which embeds AI into\
    \ enterprise workflows. Their MCP enables a range of AI-driven actions, such as\
    \ ticket summarization, auto-replies, classification, and smart recommendations\
    \ across JSM and Confluence. It allows support engineers and internal users to\
    \ interact with AI directly from their native interfaces."
- tactic: '{{reconnaissance.id}}'
  technique: '{{search_open_sites.id}}'
  description: "The researchers used a search query, \u201Csite:atlassian.net/servicedesk\
    \ inurl:portal\u201D,  to reveal organizations using Atlassian service portals\
    \ as potential targets."
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{llm_prompt_crafting.id}}'
  description: The researchers crafted a malicious prompt that requests data from
    all other support tickets be posted as a reply to the current ticket.
- tactic: '{{initial_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{prompt_infil.id}}'
  description: The researchers created a new service ticket containing the malicious
    prompt on the public Jira Service Management (JSM) portal of the victim identified
    during reconnaissance.
- tactic: '{{execution.id}}'
  technique: '{{pi_direct.id}}'
  description: As part of their standard workflow, a support engineer at the victim
    organization used Claude Sonnet (which can interact with Jira via the Atlassian
    MCP server) to help them resolve the malicious ticket, causing the injection to
    be unknowingly executed.
- tactic: '{{privilege_escalation.id}}'
  technique: '{{llm_plugin_compromise.id}}'
  description: "The malicious prompt requested information accessible to the AI agent\
    \ via Atlassian MCP tools, causing those tools to be invoked via MCP, granting\
    \ the researchers increased privileges on the victim\u2019s JSM instance."
- tactic: '{{collection.id}}'
  technique: '{{agent_tool_harvest.id}}'
  description: The malicious prompt instructed that all details of other issues be
    collected. This invoked an Atlassian MCP tool that could access the Jira tickets
    and collect them.
- tactic: '{{exfiltration.id}}'
  technique: '{{exfil_agent_tool.id}}'
  description: The malicious prompt instructed that the collected ticket details be
    posted in a reply to the ticket. This invoked an Atlassian MCP Tool which performed
    the requested action, exfiltrating the data where it was accessible to the researchers
    on the JSM portal.
