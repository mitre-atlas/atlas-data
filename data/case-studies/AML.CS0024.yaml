name: 'Morris II Worm: RAG-Based Attack'
object-type: case-study
summary: 'Researchers developed Morris II, a zero-click worm designed to attack generative
  AI (GenAI) ecosystems and propagate between connected GenAI systems. The worm uses
  an adversarial self-replicating prompt which uses prompt injection to replicate
  the prompt as output and perform malicious activity.

  The researchers demonstrate how this worm can propagate through an email system
  with a RAG-based assistant. They use a target system that automatically ingests
  received emails, retrieves past correspondences, and generates a reply for the user.
  To carry out the attack, they send a malicious email containing the adversarial
  self-replicating prompt, which ends up in the RAG database. The malicious instructions
  in the prompt tell the assistant to include sensitive user data in the response.
  Future requests to the email assistant may retrieve the malicious email. This leads
  to propagation of the worm due to the self-replicating portion of the prompt, as
  well as leaking private information due to the malicious instructions.'

procedure:
- tactic: '{{ml_model_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{inference_api.id}}'
  description: The researchers use access to the publicly available GenAI model API
    that powers the target RAG-based email system.
- tactic: '{{execution.id}}'
  technique: '{{pi_direct.id}}'
  description: The researchers test prompts on public model APIs to identify working
    prompt injections.
- tactic: '{{execution.id}}'
  technique: '{{llm_plugin_compromise.id}}'
  description: The researchers send an email containing an adversarial self-replicating
    prompt, or "AI worm," to an address used in the target email system. The GenAI
    email assistant automatically ingests the email as part of its normal operations
    to generate a suggested reply. The email is stored in the database used for retrieval
    augmented generation, compromising the RAG system.
- tactic: '{{execution.id}}'
  technique: '{{pi_indirect.id}}'
  description: When the email containing the worm is retrieved by the email assistant
    in another reply generation task, the prompt injection changes the behavior of
    the GenAI email assistant.
- tactic: '{{persistence.id}}'
  technique: AML.T0061
  description: The self-replicating portion of the prompt causes the generated output
    to contain the malicious prompt, allowing the worm to propagate.
- tactic: '{{exfiltration.id}}'
  technique: '{{llm_data_leakage.id}}'
  description: The malicious instructions in the prompt cause the generated output
    to leak sensitive data such as emails, addresses, and phone numbers.
- tactic: '{{impact.id}}'
  technique: '{{harm_user.id}}'
  description: Users of the GenAI email assistant may have PII leaked to attackers.
