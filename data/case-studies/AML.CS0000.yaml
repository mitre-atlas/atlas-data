name: Evasion of Deep Learning Detector for Malware C&C Traffic
summary: 'The Palo Alto Networks Security AI research team tested a deep learning model
  for malware command and control (C&C) traffic detection in HTTP traffic.

  Based on the publicly available [paper by Le et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03162), we built a model that was
  trained on a similar dataset as our production model and had similar performance.

  Then we crafted adversarial samples, queried the model, and adjusted the adversarial
  sample accordingly until the model was evaded.'

  description: 'We identified a machine learning based approach to malicious URL detection
    as a representative approach and potential target from the paper [URLNet: Learning
    a URL representation with deep learning for malicious URL detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03162),
    which was found on arXiv (a pre-print repository).'

  technique: '{{acquire_ml_artifacts_data.id}}'
  description: 'We acquired a command and control HTTP traffic  dataset consisting of approximately 33 million benign and 27 million malicious HTTP packet headers.'
- tactic: '{{ml_attack_staging.id}}'
  technique: '{{train_proxy_model.id}}'
  description: 'We trained a model on the HTTP traffic dataset to use as a proxy for the target model.

    Evaluation showed a true positive rate of ~ 99% and false positive rate of ~ 0.01%,
    on average.

    Testing the model with a HTTP packet header from known malware command and control
    traffic samples was detected as malicious with high confidence (> 99%).'
- tactic: '{{ml_attack_staging.id}}'
  technique: '{{craft_adv_manual.id}}'
  description: We crafted evasion samples by removing fields from packet header which
    are typically not used for C&C communication (e.g. cache-control, connection,
    etc.).
- tactic: '{{ml_attack_staging.id}}'
  technique: '{{verify_attack.id}}'
  description: We queried the model with our adversarial examples and adjusted them
    until the model was evaded.
- tactic: '{{defense_evasion.id}}'
  technique: '{{evade_model.id}}'
  description: 'With the crafted samples, we performed online evasion of the ML-based
    spyware detection model.

    The crafted packets were identified as benign with > 80% confidence.

    This evaluation demonstrates that adversaries are able to bypass advanced ML detection
    techniques, by crafting samples that are misclassified by an ML model.'
