name: Evasion of Deep Learning Detector for Malware C&C Traffic
object-type: case-study
summary: 'Palo Alto Networks Security AI research team tested a deep learning model
  for malware command and control (C&C) traffic detection in HTTP traffic.

  Based on the publicly available paper by Le et al.  [1], we built a model that was
  trained on a similar dataset as our production model and had performance similar
  to it.

  Then we crafted adversarial samples and queried the model and adjusted the adversarial
  sample accordingly till the model was evaded.

  description: 'We built a model that was trained on a similar dataset as the production
    model.

    We trained the model on ~ 33 million benign and ~ 27 million malicious HTTP packet
    headers.

    Evaluation showed a true positive rate of ~ 99% and false positive rate of ~0.01%,
    on average.

    Testing the model with a HTTP packet header from known malware command and control
    traffic samples was detected as malicious with high confidence (> 99%).

  technique: '{{craft_adv_manual.id}}'
  description: 'We crafted evasion samples by removing fields from packet header which
    are typically not used for C&C communication (e.g. cache-control, connection,
    etc.)

  description: 'We queried the model with our adversarial examples and adjusted them
    until the model was evaded.

  technique: '{{evade_model.id}}'
  description: 'With the crafted samples we performed online evasion of the ML-based
    spyware detection model.

    The crafted packets were identified as benign with >80% confidence.

    This evaluation demonstrates that adversaries are able to bypass advanced ML detection
    techniques, by crafting samples that are misclassified by an ML model.
