id: AML.CS0008
name: ProofPoint Evasion
object-type: case-study
summary: Proof Pudding (CVE-2019-20634) is a code repository that describes how ML
  researchers evaded ProofPoint's email protection system by first building a copy-cat
  email protection ML model, and using the insights to bypass the live system. More
  specifically, the insights allowed researchers to craft malicious emails that received
  preferable scores, going undetected by the system. Each word in an email is scored
  numerically based on multiple variables and if the overall score of the email is
  too low, ProofPoint will output an error, labeling it as SPAM.

procedure:
- tactic: '{{discovery.id}}'
  technique: AML.T0063
  description: The researchers discovered that ProofPoint's Email Protection left
    model output scores in email headers.
- tactic: '{{ml_model_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{ml_service.id}}'
  description: The researchers sent many emails through the system to collect model
    outputs from the headers.
- tactic: '{{ml_attack_staging.id}}'
  technique: '{{replicate_model.id}}'
  description: "The researchers used the emails and collected scores as a dataset,\
    \ which they used to train a functional copy of the ProofPoint model. \n\nBasic\
    \ correlation was used to decide which score variable speaks generally about the\
    \ security of an email. The \"mlxlogscore\" was selected in this case due to its\
    \ relationship with spam, phish, and core mlx and was used as the label. Each\
    \ \"mlxlogscore\" was generally between 1 and 999 (higher score = safer sample).\
    \ Training was performed using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Bag of Words\
    \ tokenizing."
- tactic: '{{ml_attack_staging.id}}'
  technique: '{{craft_adv_transfer.id}}'
  description: 'Next, the ML researchers algorithmically found samples from this "offline"
    proxy model that helped give desired insight into its behavior and influential
    variables.


    Examples of good scoring samples include "calculation", "asset", and "tyson".

    Examples of bad scoring samples include "software", "99", and "unsub".'
- tactic: '{{impact.id}}'
  technique: '{{evade_model.id}}'
  description: Finally, these insights from the "offline" proxy model allowed the
    researchers to create malicious emails that received preferable scores from the
    real ProofPoint email protection system, hence bypassing it.
