id: AML.CS0008
name: ProofPoint Evasion
object-type: case-study
summary: 'CVE-2019-20634 describes how ML researchers evaded ProofPoint''s email protection
  system by first building a copy-cat email protection ML model, and using the insights
  to evade the live system.

incident-date: 2019-09-09
incident-date-granularity: DATE
procedure:
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{acquire_ml_artifacts.id}}'
  description: 'The researchers first gathered the scores from the Proofpoint''s ML
    system used in email headers by sending a large number of emails through the system
    and scraping the model scores exposed in the logs.

    '
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{acquire_ml_artifacts_data.id}}'
  description: 'The researchers converted the collected scores into a dataset.

    '
- tactic: '{{ml_attack_staging.id}}'
  technique: '{{train_proxy_model.id}}'
  description: 'Using these scores, the researchers replicated the ML mode by building
    a "shadow" aka copy-cat ML model.

    '
- tactic: '{{ml_attack_staging.id}}'
  technique: '{{craft_adv_whitebox.id}}'
  description: 'Next, the ML researchers algorithmically found samples that this "offline"
    copy cat model.

    '
- tactic: '{{ml_attack_staging.id}}'
  technique: '{{craft_adv_transfer.id}}'
  description: 'Finally, these insights from the offline model allowed the researchers
    to create malicious emails that received preferable scores from the real ProofPoint
    email protection system, hence bypassing it.
