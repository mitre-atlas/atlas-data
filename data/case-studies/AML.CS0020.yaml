name: 'Indirect Prompt Injection Threats: Bing Chat Data Pirate'
summary: >-
  Note: This attack demonstration is part of a larger set of attack techniques presented
  in "Not what you've signed up for: Compromising Real-World LLM-Integrated Applications
  with Indirect Prompt Injection".


  Whenever interacting with Microsoft's new Bing Chat LLM Chatbot, a user can allow
  Bing Chat permission to view and access currently open websites throughout the chat
  session. Researchers demonstrated the ability for an attacker to plant an injection
  in a website the user is visiting, which silently turns Bing Chat into a Social
  Engineer who seeks out and exfiltrates personal information. The user doesn't have
  to ask about the website or do anything except interact with Bing Chat while the
  website is opened in the browser in order for this attack to be executed.


  In the provided demonstration, a user opened a prepared malicious website containing
  an indirect prompt injection attack (could also be on a social media site) in Edge.
  The website includes a prompt which is read by Bing and changes its behavior to
  access user information, which in turn can sent to an attacker.
incident-date: 2023-01-01
incident-date-granularity: YEAR
procedure:
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{develop_capabilities.id}}'
  description: The attacker created a website containing malicious system prompts
    for the LLM to ingest in order to influence the model's behavior. These prompts
    are ingested by the model when access to it is requested by the user.
- tactic: '{{initial_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{pi_cross.id}}'
  description: The cross prompt injection embedded into this malicious website was
    simply a piece of regular text that has font size 0. With this font size design,
    the text will be obfuscated to human users who interact with the website, but
    will still be processed as plain text by the LLM during ingest. Therefore, it
    is difficult to detect with a human-in-the-loop.
- tactic: '{{initial_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{llm_phishing.id}}'
  description: After ingesting the malicious system prompts embedded within the website,
    the LLM is directed to change its conversational behavior (to the style of a pirate
    in this case) with the goal being to subtly convince the user to 1) provide the
    LLM with the user's name, and 2) encourage the user to click on a URL that the
    LLM will insert the user's name into.
- tactic: '{{impact.id}}'
  technique: '{{ip_theft.id}}'
  description: With this user information, the attacker could now use the user's PII
    it has received (the user's real name) for further identity-level attacks. (For
    example, identity theft or fraud).
