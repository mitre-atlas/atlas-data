name: Botnet Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) Detection Evasion
object-type: case-study
case-study-type: exercise
actor: Palo Alto Networks AI Research Team
target: Palo Alto Networks ML-based DGA detection module
summary:
  'The Palo Alto Networks Security AI research team was able to bypass a Convolutional Neural Network based botnet Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) detector using a generic domain name mutation technique.

  It is a generic domain mutation technique which can evade most ML-based DGA detection
  modules.

  The generic mutation technique evades most ML-based DGA detection modules DGA and can be used to test the effectiveness and robustness
  of all DGA detection methods developed by security companies in the industry before
  they is deployed to the production environment.'

      'The researchers acquired a publicly available CNN-based DGA detection
      model and tested it against a well-known DGA generated domain name data sets,
      which includes ~50 million domain names from 64 botnet DGA families.

      The CNN-based DGA detection model shows more than 70% detection accuracy on 16
      (~25%) botnet DGA families.'
