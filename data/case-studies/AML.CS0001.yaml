name: Botnet Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) Detection Evasion
object-type: case-study
summary: 'The Palo Alto Networks Security AI research team was able to bypass a Convolutional
  Neural Network (CNN)-based botnet Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) detection [1]
  by domain name mutations.

  It is a generic domain mutation technique which can evade most ML-based DGA detection
  modules.

  The generic mutation technique can also be used to test the effectiveness and robustness
  of all DGA detection methods developed by security companies in the industry before
  it is deployed to the production environment.

  description: 'The researchers acquired a publicly available CNN-based DGA detection
    model [1] and tested against a well-known DGA generated domain name data sets,
    which includes ~50 million domain names from 64 botnet DGA families.

    The CNN-based DGA detection model shows more than 70% detection accuracy on 16
    (~25%) botnet DGA families.
