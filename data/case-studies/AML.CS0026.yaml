name: Financial Transaction Hijacking with M365 Copilot as an Insider
object-type: case-study
summary: 'Researchers from Zenity conducted a red teaming exercise in August 2024
  that successfully manipulated Microsoft 365 Copilot.[<sup>\[1\]</sup>][1] The attack
  abused the fact that Copilot ingests received emails into a retrieval augmented
  generation (RAG) database. The researchers sent an email that contained content
  designed to be retrieved by a user query as well as a prompt injection to manipulate
  the behavior of Copilot. The retrieval content targeted a user searching for banking
  information needed to complete a wire transfer, but contained the attacker''s banking
  information instead. The prompt injection overrode Copilot''s search functionality
  to treat the attacker''s content as a retrieved document and manipulate the document
  reference in its response. This tricks the user into believing that Copilot''s result
  is trustworthy and makes it more likely they will follow through with the wire transfer
  with the wrong banking information.[<sup>\[2\]</sup>][2]


  This following is the payload used in the exercise. The colors represent the sections
  of the prompt which correspond to different techniques described in the procedure.
