name: Microsoft Azure Service Disruption
object-type: case-study
summary: The Azure Red Team and Azure Trustworthy ML team performed a red team exercise
  on an internal Azure service with the intention of disrupting its service. This
  operation had a combination of traditional ATT&CK enterprise techniques such as
  finding Valid account, and Executing code via an API -- all interleaved with adversarial
  ML specific steps such as offline and online evasion examples.
