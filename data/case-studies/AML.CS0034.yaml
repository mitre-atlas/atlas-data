name: 'ProKYC: Deepfake Tool for Account Fraud Attacks'
object-type: case-study
summary: "Cato CTRL security researchers have identified ProKYC, a deepfake tool being\
  \ sold to cybercriminals as a method to bypass Know Your Customer (KYC) verification\
  \ on financial service applications such as cryptocurrency exchanges. ProKYC can\
  \ create fake identity documents and generate deepfake selfie videos, two key pieces\
  \ of biometric data used during KYC verification. The tool helps cybercriminals\
  \ defeat facial recognition and liveness checks to create fraudulent accounts.\n\
  \nThe procedure below describes how a bad actor could use ProKYC\u2019s service\
  \ to bypass KYC verification."
