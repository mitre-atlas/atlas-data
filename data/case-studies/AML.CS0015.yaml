object-type: case-study
name: Compromised PyTorch Dependency Chain
summary: >-
  Linux packages for PyTorch's pre-release version, called Pytorch-nightly,
  were compromised from December 25 to 30, 2022 by a malicious binary uploaded to the Python Package Index
  (PyPI) code repository.  The malicious binary had the same name as a PyTorch dependency
  and the PyPI package manager (pip) installed this malicious package instead of the legitimate one.


  This supply chain attack, also known as "dependency confusion," exposed sensitive
  information of Linux machines with the affected pip-installed versions of PyTorch-nightly.
  On December 30, 2022, PyTorch announced the incident and initial steps towards mitigation,
  including the rename and removal of `torchtriton` dependencies.

- tactic: AML.TA0004

  description: >-
    A malicious dependency package named `torchtriton` was uploaded to the
    PyPI code repository with the same package name
    as a package shipped with the PyTorch-nightly build. This malicious
    package contained additional code that uploads sensitive data
    from the machine.

    The malicious `torchtriton` package was installed instead of the legitimate one because
    PyPI is prioritized over other sources. See more details at [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8606).

  description: >-
    The malicious package surveys the affected system for basic
    fingerprinting info (such as IP address, username, and current working
    directory), and steals further sensitive data, including:

    - nameservers from `/etc/resolv.conf`

    - hostname from `gethostname()`

    - current username from `getlogin()`

    - current working directory name from `getcwd()`

    - environment variables

    - `/etc/hosts`

    - `/etc/passwd`

    - the first 1000 files in the user's `$HOME` directory

    - `$HOME/.gitconfig`

    - `$HOME/.ssh/*.`

    All gathered information, including file contents, is uploaded via
    encrypted DNS queries to the domain `*[dot]h4ck[dot]cfd`, using the DNS
    server `wheezy[dot]io`.
