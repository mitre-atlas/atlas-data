name: Compromised PyTorch Dependency Chain
object-type: case-study
summary: 'Linux packages for PyTorch''s pre-release version, called Pytorch-nightly,
  were compromised from December 25 to 30, 2022 by a malicious binary uploaded to
  the Python Package Index (PyPI) code repository.  The malicious binary had the same
  name as a PyTorch dependency and the PyPI package manager (pip) installed this malicious
  package instead of the legitimate one.


  This supply chain attack, also known as "dependency confusion," exposed sensitive
  information of Linux machines with the affected pip-installed versions of PyTorch-nightly.
  On December 30, 2022, PyTorch announced the incident and initial steps towards mitigation,
  including the rename and removal of `torchtriton` dependencies.'

  description: 'A malicious dependency package named `torchtriton` was uploaded to
    the PyPI code repository with the same package name as a package shipped with
    the PyTorch-nightly build. This malicious package contained additional code that
    uploads sensitive data from the machine.

    The malicious `torchtriton` package was installed instead of the legitimate one
    because PyPI is prioritized over other sources. See more details at [this GitHub
    issue](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8606).'

  technique: '{{local_system.id}}'
  description: 'The malicious package surveys the affected system for basic fingerprinting
    info (such as IP address, username, and current working directory), and steals
    further sensitive data, including:

    - nameservers from `/etc/resolv.conf`

    - hostname from `gethostname()`

    - current username from `getlogin()`

    - current working directory name from `getcwd()`

    - environment variables

    - `/etc/hosts`

    - `/etc/passwd`

    - the first 1000 files in the user''s `$HOME` directory

    - `$HOME/.gitconfig`

    - `$HOME/.ssh/*.`'
- tactic: '{{exfiltration.id}}'
  technique: '{{exfiltrate_via_cyber.id}}'
  description: All gathered information, including file contents, is uploaded via
    encrypted DNS queries to the domain `*[dot]h4ck[dot]cfd`, using the DNS server
    `wheezy[dot]io`.
