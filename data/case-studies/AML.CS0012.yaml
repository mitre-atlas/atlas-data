name: Face Identification System Evasion via Physical Countermeasures
object-type: case-study
summary: 'MITRE''s AI Red Team demonstrated a physical-domain evasion attack on a
  commercial face identification service with the intention of inducing a targeted
  misclassification.

  This operation had a combination of traditional ATT&CK enterprise techniques such
  as finding Valid account, and Executing code via an API - all interleaved with adversarial
  ML specific attacks.
