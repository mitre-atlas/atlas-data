id: AML.CS0012
name: Face Identification System Evasion via Physical Countermeasures
object-type: case-study
summary: 'MITRE''s AI Red Team demonstrated a physical-domain evasion attack on a
  commercial face identification service with the intention of inducing a targeted
  misclassification.

  This operation had a combination of traditional MITRE ATT&CK techniques such
  as finding valid accounts and executing code via an API - all interleaved with adversarial
  ML specific attacks.
