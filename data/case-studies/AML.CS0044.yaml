name: 'LAMEHUG: Malware Leveraging Dynamic AI-Generated Commands'
object-type: case-study
summary: 'In July 2025, Ukrainian authorities reported the emergence of LAMEHUG, a
  new AI-powered malware attributed to the Russian state-backed threat actor [APT28](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007/)
  (also tracked as Forest Blizzard or UAC-0001). LAMEHUG uses a large language model
  (LLM) to dynamically generate commands on the infected hosts.


  The campaign began with a phishing attack leveraging a compromised government email
  account to deliver a malicious ZIP archive disguised as Appendix.pdf.zip. The archive
  contained the LAMEHUG malware, a Python-based executable, packed with PyInstaller.
  When executed, the malware, makes calls to an LLM endpoint to generate malicious
  from natural language prompts. Dynamically generated commands may make the malware
  harder to detect. LAMEHUG was configured to collect files from the local system
  and exfiltrate them.'
