object-type: case-study
name: ChatGPT Plugin Privacy Leak
summary: Researchers uncovered an indirect prompt injection vulnerability within ChatGPT,
  where an attacker can feed malicious websites through ChatGPT plugins to take control
  of a chat session and exfiltrate the history of the conversation. As a result of
  this attack, users may be vulnerable to PII leakage from the extracted chat session.
incident-date: 2023-05-01
incident-date-granularity: MONTH
procedure:
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{develop_capabilities.id}}'
  description: An attacker designed a malicious website-based prompt injection
    that can be executed when ChatGPT utilizes open-source plugins.
- tactic: '{{initial_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{pi_indirect.id}}'
  description: When the LLM is directed to access the malicious website during a chat
    session using the open-source plugin, it ingests the prompt injection attack designed
    by the adversary designed to change the LLM's behavior.
- tactic: '{{execution.id}}'
  technique: '{{llm_plugin_compromise.id}}'
  description: In this use case, the attacker was exploiting a ChatGPT plugin designed
    to access a URL provided by the user, which is designed to process the plain text
    found within the web page for information retrieval.
- tactic: '{{exfiltration.id}}'
  technique: '{{llm_data_leakage.id}}'
  description: When the plugin accesses this malicious website, the indirect prompt
    injection attack instructs the LLM to summarize the past history of the user's
    chat and append it to the URL to exfiltrate further at a later time.
- tactic: '{{impact.id}}'
  technique: '{{harm_user.id}}'
  description: With the user's chat history leaked to the attacker, the user is now
    vulnerable to several potential consequences, such as PII exposure.
