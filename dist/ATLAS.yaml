      and as a means to input data to the model.

      The level of access can range from the full knowledge of the internals of the

      in the AI model.

      The adversary may use varying levels of model access during the course of their
      attack, from staging the attack to impacting the target system.


      Access to an AI model may require access to the system housing the model, the
      model may be publically accessible via an API, or it may be accessed indirectly
      via interaction with a product or service that utilizes AI as part of its processes.'

    that based on string similarity the samples were all equivalent, and based on
    code similarity they were between 98 and 74 percent similar. Interestingly enough,
    the compile time was the same for all the samples. After more digging, researchers

  object-type: case-study
  summary: 'Machine translation services (such as Google Translate, Bing Translator,
    and Systran Translate) provide public-facing UIs and APIs.

    A research group at UC Berkeley utilized these public endpoints to create a replicated
    model with near-production state-of-the-art translation quality.

    Beyond demonstrating that IP can be functionally stolen from a black-box system,
    they used the replicated model to successfully transfer adversarial examples to
    the real production services.

    These adversarial inputs successfully cause targeted word flips, vulgar outputs,

  summary: 'Clearview AI makes a facial recognition tool that searches publicly available
    photos for matches.  This tool has been used for investigative purposes by law
    enforcement agencies and other parties.


    Clearview AI''s source code repository, though password protected, was misconfigured
    to allow an arbitrary user to register an account.

    This allowed an external researcher to gain access to a private code repository
    that contained Clearview AI production credentials, keys to cloud storage buckets

    With access to training data, a bad actor has the ability to cause an arbitrary

    These kinds of attacks illustrate that any attempt to secure ML system should

  summary: 'OpenAI built GPT-2, a language model capable of generating high quality
    text samples. Over concerns that GPT-2 could be used for malicious purposes such
    as impersonating others, or generating misleading news articles, fake social media
    content, or spam, OpenAI adopted a tiered release schedule. They initially released
    a smaller, less powerful version of GPT-2 along with a technical description of
    the approach, but held back the full trained model.


    Before the full model was released by OpenAI, researchers at Brown University
    successfully replicated the model using information released by OpenAI and open
    source ML artifacts. This demonstrates that a bad actor with sufficient technical
    skill and compute resources could have replicated GPT-2 and used it for harmful

  name: Achieving Code Execution in MathGPT via Prompt Injection
  object-type: case-study
  summary: 'The publicly available Streamlit application [MathGPT](https://mathgpt.streamlit.app/)
    uses GPT-3, a large language model (LLM), to answer user-generated math questions.


    Recent studies and experiments have shown that LLMs such as GPT-3 show poor performance
    when it comes to performing exact math directly[<sup>\[1\]</sup>][1][<sup>\[2\]</sup>][2].
    However, they can produce more accurate answers when asked to generate executable
    code that solves the question at hand. In the MathGPT application, GPT-3 is used
    to convert the user''s natural language question into Python code that is then
    executed. After computation, the executed code and the answer are displayed to
    the user.


    Some LLMs can be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious user
    inputs cause the models to perform unexpected behavior[<sup>\[3\]</sup>][3][<sup>\[4\]</sup>][4].   In
    this incident, the actor explored several prompt-override avenues, producing code
    that eventually led to the actor gaining access to the application host system''s
    environment variables and the application''s GPT-3 API key, as well as executing
    a denial of service attack.  As a result, the actor could have exhausted the application''s
    API query budget or brought down the application.


    After disclosing the attack vectors and their results to the MathGPT and Streamlit
    teams, the teams took steps to mitigate the vulnerabilities, filtering on select
    prompts and rotating the API key.

  object-type: case-study
  summary: 'Whenever interacting with Microsoft''s new Bing Chat LLM Chatbot, a user
    can allow Bing Chat permission to view and access currently open websites throughout
    the chat session. Researchers demonstrated the ability for an attacker to plant
    an injection in a website the user is visiting, which silently turns Bing Chat
    into a Social Engineer who seeks out and exfiltrates personal information. The
    user doesn''t have to ask about the website or do anything except interact with
    Bing Chat while the website is opened in the browser in order for this attack
    to be executed.


    In the provided demonstration, a user opened a prepared malicious website containing
    an indirect prompt injection attack (could also be on a social media site) in
    Edge. The website includes a prompt which is read by Bing and changes its behavior
    to access user information, which in turn can sent to an attacker.'

    Ray''s Job API allows for arbitrary remote execution by design. However, it does
    not offer authentication, and the default configuration may expose the cluster
    to the internet. Researchers at Oligo discovered that Ray clusters have been actively
    exploited for at least seven months. Adversaries can use victim organization''s

    of the compromised machines to be nearly 1 billion USD.


    Five vulnerabilities in Ray were reported to Anyscale, the maintainers of Ray.
    Anyscale promptly fixed four of the five vulnerabilities. However, the fifth vulnerability
    [CVE-2023-48022](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48022) remains disputed.
    Anyscale maintains that Ray''s lack of authentication is a design decision, and
    that Ray is meant to be deployed in a safe network environment. The Oligo researchers
    deem this a "shadow vulnerability" because in disputed status, the CVE does not

  summary: 'Researchers developed Morris II, a zero-click worm designed to attack

    The worm uses an adversarial self-replicating prompt which uses prompt injection

    The researchers demonstrate how this worm can propagate through an email system
    with a RAG-based assistant. They use a target system that automatically ingests
    received emails, retrieves past correspondences, and generates a reply for the
    user. To carry out the attack, they send a malicious email containing the adversarial
    self-replicating prompt, which ends up in the RAG database. The malicious instructions
    in the prompt tell the assistant to include sensitive user data in the response.
    Future requests to the email assistant may retrieve the malicious email. This
    leads to propagation of the worm due to the self-replicating portion of the prompt,

  name: Financial Transaction Hijacking with M365 Copilot as an Insider
  object-type: case-study
  summary: 'Researchers from Zenity conducted a red teaming exercise in August 2024
    that successfully manipulated Microsoft 365 Copilot.[<sup>\[1\]</sup>][1] The
    attack abused the fact that Copilot ingests received emails into a retrieval augmented
    generation (RAG) database. The researchers sent an email that contained content
    designed to be retrieved by a user query as well as a prompt injection to manipulate
    the behavior of Copilot. The retrieval content targeted a user searching for banking
    information needed to complete a wire transfer, but contained the attacker''s
    banking information instead. The prompt injection overrode Copilot''s search functionality
    to treat the attacker''s content as a retrieved document and manipulate the document
    reference in its response. This tricks the user into believing that Copilot''s
    result is trustworthy and makes it more likely they will follow through with the
    wire transfer with the wrong banking information.[<sup>\[2\]</sup>][2]

  summary: 'Researchers at Trend Micro, Inc. used service indexing portals and web
    searching tools to identify over 8,000 misconfigured private container registries
    exposed on the internet. Approximately 70% of the registries also had overly permissive
    access controls that allowed write access. In their analysis, the researchers

    these open registries that could be pulled without authentication.


    This exposure could allow adversaries to download, inspect, and modify container
    contents, including sensitive AI model files. This is an exposure of valuable
    intellectual property which could be stolen by an adversary. Compromised images
    could also be pushed to the registry, leading to a supply chain attack, allowing

  summary: 'Researchers at ReversingLabs have identified malicious models containing

    to de-serialize fully. Picklescan relied on being able to fully de-serialize the
    model.


    Since becoming aware of this issue, Hugging Face has removed the models and has
    made changes to Picklescan to catch this particular attack. However, pickle files
