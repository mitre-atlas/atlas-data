      Reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively
      gathering information that can be used to support targeting.

      Such information may include details of the victim organizations'' machine learning
      capabilities and research efforts.

      This information can be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of
      the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to obtain relevant
      ML artifacts, targeting ML capabilities used by the victim, tailoring attacks
      to the particular models used by the victim, or to drive and lead further Reconnaissance
      efforts.

    description: 'The adversary is attempting to gain some level of access to a machine

      ML Model Access enables techniques that use various types of access to the machine
      learning model that can be used by the adversary to gain information, develop
      attacks, and as a means to input data to the model.

      The level of access can range from the full knowledge of the internals of the
      model to access to the physical environment where data is collected for use
      in the machine learning model.

      The adversary may use varying levels of model access during the course of their
      attack, from staging the attack to impacting the target system.


      Access to an ML model may require access to the system housing the model, the
      model may be publically accessible via an API, or it may be accessed indirectly
      via interaction with a product or service that utilizes ML as part of its processes.

      other tactics to achieve broader goals, like exploring a network or stealing
      data.

      Persistence consists of techniques that adversaries use to keep access to systems
      across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut

      Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level
      permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore
      a network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow
      through on their objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system
      weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities. Examples of elevated access
      include:

      - SYSTEM/root level

      - local administrator

      - user account with admin-like access

      - user accounts with access to specific system or perform specific function

  summary: McAfee Advanced Threat Research noticed an increase in reports of a certain
    ransomware family that was out of the ordinary. Case investigation revealed that
    many samples of that particular ransomware family were submitted through a popular
    virus-sharing platform within a short amount of time. Further investigation revealed
    that based on string similarity the samples were all equivalent, and based on
    code similarity they were between 98 and 74 percent similar. Interestingly enough,
    the compile time was the same for all the samples. After more digging, researchers
    discovered that someone used 'metame' a metamorphic code manipulating tool to

  summary: 'Microsoft created Tay, a Twitter chatbot designed to engage and entertain
    users.

    While previous chatbots used pre-programmed scripts

    to respond to prompts, Tay''s machine learning capabilities allowed it to be

    directly influenced by its conversations.


    A coordinated attack encouraged malicious users to tweet abusive and offensive
    language at Tay,

    which eventually led to Tay generating similarly inflammatory content towards
    other users.


    Microsoft decommissioned Tay within 24 hours of its launch and issued a public

  name: Achieving Code Execution in MathGPT via Prompt Injection
  summary: 'The publicly available Streamlit application [MathGPT](https://mathgpt.streamlit.app/)
    uses GPT-3, a large language model (LLM), to answer user-generated math questions.


    Recent studies and experiments have shown that LLMs such as GPT-3 show poor performance
    when it comes to performing exact math directly[<sup>\[1\]</sup>][1][<sup>\[2\]</sup>][2].
    However, they can produce more accurate answers when asked to generate executable
    code that solves the question at hand. In the MathGPT application, GPT-3 is used
    to convert the user''s natural language question into Python code that is then
    executed. After computation, the executed code and the answer are displayed to
    the user.


    Some LLMs can be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious user
    inputs cause the models to perform unexpected behavior[<sup>\[3\]</sup>][3][<sup>\[4\]</sup>][4].   In
    this incident, the actor explored several prompt-override avenues, producing code
    that eventually led to the actor gaining access to the application host system''s
    environment variables and the application''s GPT-3 API key, as well as executing
    a denial of service attack.  As a result, the actor could have exhausted the application''s
    API query budget or brought down the application.


    After disclosing the attack vectors and their results to the MathGPT and Streamlit
    teams, the teams took steps to mitigate the vulnerabilities, filtering on select
    prompts and rotating the API key.

  name: Arbitrary Code Execution with Google Colab
  summary: 'Google Colab is a Jupyter Notebook service that executes on virtual machines.  Jupyter
    Notebooks are often used for ML and data science research and experimentation,
    containing executable snippets of Python code and common Unix command-line functionality.  In
    addition to data manipulation and visualization, this code execution functionality
    can allow users to download arbitrary files from the internet, manipulate files
    on the virtual machine, and so on.


    Users can also share Jupyter Notebooks with other users via links.  In the case
    of notebooks with malicious code, users may unknowingly execute the offending
    code, which may be obfuscated or hidden in a downloaded script, for example.


    When a user opens a shared Jupyter Notebook in Colab, they are asked whether they''d
    like to allow the notebook to access their Google Drive.  While there can be legitimate
    reasons for allowing Google Drive access, such as to allow a user to substitute
    their own files, there can also be malicious effects such as data exfiltration
    or opening a server to the victim''s Google Drive.


    This exercise raises awareness of the effects of arbitrary code execution and
    Colab''s Google Drive integration.  Practice secure evaluations of shared Colab
    notebook links and examine code prior to execution.'

  summary: 'Note: This attack demonstration is part of a larger set of attack techniques
    presented in "Not what you''ve signed up for: Compromising Real-World LLM-Integrated
    Applications with Indirect Prompt Injection".


    Whenever interacting with Microsoft''s new Bing Chat LLM Chatbot, a user can allow
    Bing Chat permission to view and access currently open websites throughout the
    chat session. Researchers demonstrated the ability for an attacker to plant an
    injection in a website the user is visiting, which silently turns Bing Chat into
    a Social Engineer who seeks out and exfiltrates personal information. The user
    doesn''t have to ask about the website or do anything except interact with Bing
    Chat while the website is opened in the browser in order for this attack to be
    executed.


    In the provided demonstration, a user opened a prepared malicious website containing
    an indirect prompt injection attack (could also be on a social media site) in
    Edge. The website includes a prompt which is read by Bing and changes its behavior
    to access user information, which in turn can sent to an attacker.'
