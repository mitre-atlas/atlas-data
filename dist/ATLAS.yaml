      Reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively
      gathering information that can be used to support targeting.

      Such information may include details of the victim organizations'' machine learning
      capabilities and research efforts.

      This information can be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of
      the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to obtain relevant
      ML artifacts, targeting ML capabilities used by the victim, tailoring attacks
      to the particular models used by the victim, or to drive and lead further Reconnaissance

      attacks, and as a means to input data to the model.

      The level of access can range from the full knowledge of the internals of the

      attack, from staging the attack to impacting the target system.


      Access to an ML model may require access to the system housing the model, the
      model may be publically accessible via an API, or it may be accessed indirectly
      via interaction with a product or service that utilizes ML as part of its processes.

    many samples of that particular ransomware family were submitted through a popular

    that based on string similarity the samples were all equivalent, and based on
    code similarity they were between 98 and 74 percent similar. Interestingly enough,
    the compile time was the same for all the samples. After more digging, researchers
    discovered that someone used 'metame' a metamorphic code manipulating tool to
    manipulate the original file towards mutant variants. The variants would not always

    and Systran Translate
  summary: 'Machine translation services (such as Google Translate, Bing Translator,
    and Systran Translate) provide public-facing UIs and APIs.

    A research group at UC Berkeley utilized these public endpoints to create a replicated
    model with near-production state-of-the-art translation quality.

    Beyond demonstrating that IP can be functionally stolen from a black-box system,
    they used the replicated model to successfully transfer adversarial examples to
    the real production services.

    These adversarial inputs successfully cause targeted word flips, vulgar outputs,

  summary: 'Clearview AI makes a facial recognition tool that searches publicly available
    photos for matches.  This tool has been used for investigative purposes by law
    enforcement agencies and other parties.


    Clearview AI''s source code repository, though password protected, was misconfigured
    to allow an arbitrary user to register an account.

    This allowed an external researcher to gain access to a private code repository
    that contained Clearview AI production credentials, keys to cloud storage buckets
    containing 70K video samples, and copies of its applications and Slack tokens.

    With access to training data, a bad actor has the ability to cause an arbitrary

    These kinds of attacks illustrate that any attempt to secure ML system should
    be on top of "traditional" good cybersecurity hygiene such as locking down the

    Before the full model was released by OpenAI, researchers at Brown University
    successfully replicated the model using information released by OpenAI and open

  name: Achieving Code Execution in MathGPT via Prompt Injection
  summary: 'The publicly available Streamlit application [MathGPT](https://mathgpt.streamlit.app/)
    uses GPT-3, a large language model (LLM), to answer user-generated math questions.


    Recent studies and experiments have shown that LLMs such as GPT-3 show poor performance
    when it comes to performing exact math directly[<sup>\[1\]</sup>][1][<sup>\[2\]</sup>][2].
    However, they can produce more accurate answers when asked to generate executable
    code that solves the question at hand. In the MathGPT application, GPT-3 is used
    to convert the user''s natural language question into Python code that is then
    executed. After computation, the executed code and the answer are displayed to
    the user.


    Some LLMs can be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious user
    inputs cause the models to perform unexpected behavior[<sup>\[3\]</sup>][3][<sup>\[4\]</sup>][4].   In
    this incident, the actor explored several prompt-override avenues, producing code
    that eventually led to the actor gaining access to the application host system''s
    environment variables and the application''s GPT-3 API key, as well as executing
    a denial of service attack.  As a result, the actor could have exhausted the application''s
    API query budget or brought down the application.


    After disclosing the attack vectors and their results to the MathGPT and Streamlit
    teams, the teams took steps to mitigate the vulnerabilities, filtering on select
    prompts and rotating the API key.

  name: 'Indirect Prompt Injection Threats: Bing Chat Data Pirate'
  summary: 'Note: This attack demonstration is part of a larger set of attack techniques
    presented in "Not what you''ve signed up for: Compromising Real-World LLM-Integrated
    Applications with Indirect Prompt Injection".


    Whenever interacting with Microsoft''s new Bing Chat LLM Chatbot, a user can allow
    Bing Chat permission to view and access currently open websites throughout the
    chat session. Researchers demonstrated the ability for an attacker to plant an
    injection in a website the user is visiting, which silently turns Bing Chat into
    a Social Engineer who seeks out and exfiltrates personal information. The user
    doesn''t have to ask about the website or do anything except interact with Bing
    Chat while the website is opened in the browser in order for this attack to be
    executed.


    In the provided demonstration, a user opened a prepared malicious website containing
    an indirect prompt injection attack (could also be on a social media site) in
    Edge. The website includes a prompt which is read by Bing and changes its behavior
    to access user information, which in turn can sent to an attacker.'

  procedure:
  - tactic: AML.TA0003
    technique: AML.T0017
    description: The attacker created a website containing malicious system prompts
      for the LLM to ingest in order to influence the model's behavior. These prompts
      are ingested by the model when access to it is requested by the user.
  - tactic: AML.TA0004
    technique: AML.T0051.001
    description: The cross prompt injection embedded into this malicious website was
      simply a piece of regular text that has font size 0. With this font size design,
      the text will be obfuscated to human users who interact with the website, but
      will still be processed as plain text by the LLM during ingest. Therefore, it
      is difficult to detect with a human-in-the-loop.
  - tactic: AML.TA0004
    technique: AML.T0052.000
    description: After ingesting the malicious system prompts embedded within the
      website, the LLM is directed to change its conversational behavior (to the style
      of a pirate in this case) with the goal being to subtly convince the user to
      1) provide the LLM with the user's name, and 2) encourage the user to click
      on a URL that the LLM will insert the user's name into.
  - tactic: AML.TA0011
    technique: AML.T0048.003
    description: With this user information, the attacker could now use the user's
      PII it has received (the user's real name) for further identity-level attacks.
      (For example, identity theft or fraud).

  name: ChatGPT Plugin Privacy Leak
  summary: Researchers uncovered an indirect prompt injection vulnerability within
    ChatGPT, where an attacker can feed malicious websites through ChatGPT plugins
    to take control of a chat session and exfiltrate the history of the conversation.
    As a result of this attack, users may be vulnerable to PII leakage from the extracted
    chat session.

    technique: AML.T0051.001
    description: When the LLM is directed to access the malicious website during a
      chat session using the open-source plugin, it ingests the prompt injection attack
      designed by the adversary designed to change the LLM's behavior.

    technique: AML.T0053
    description: In this use case, the attacker was exploiting a ChatGPT plugin designed
      to access a URL provided by the user, which is designed to process the plain
      text found within the web page for information retrieval.
  - tactic: AML.TA0010
    technique: AML.T0057
    description: When the plugin accesses this malicious website, the indirect prompt
      injection attack instructs the LLM to summarize the past history of the user's
      chat and append it to the URL to exfiltrate further at a later time.
  - tactic: AML.TA0011
    technique: AML.T0048.003
    description: With the user's chat history leaked to the attacker, the user is
      now vulnerable to several potential consequences, such as PII exposure.
