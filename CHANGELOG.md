# ATLAS Data Changelog

## [4.0.1]() (2022-07-12)

#### Tools
- Output script checks for valid YAML file formats

#### Tests
- Added test for duplicate data object IDs

## [4.0.0]() (2022-05-27)

Support for defining multiple matrices

#### Distributed files
- `ATLAS.yaml` has a new top-level key `matrices` containing a list of matrix names, tactics, techniques, and other associated data objects
  + The `tactics` and `techniques` keys that was previously at the top-level of this file have been moved into an entry of this `matrices` key
  + Note that case studies remains at the top-level, as they can contain techniques from multiple matrices
- Updated schema files for the new format

#### Data
- New data definition file `data.yaml` containing top-level metadata, data objects, and paths to included matrix data

#### Tools
- Case study import script improvements and support for output format changes

## [3.1.0]() (2022-05-16)

Users can define custom data object types

#### Distributed files
- Case study JSON schema accepts extra top-level keys

#### Schemas
- Relaxed ID prefix patterns
  + Must start with a prefix of capital letter(s), optionally followed by numbers, then a "." (ex. AML.)
  + Optionally can repeat the above pattern (ex. AML.VER123. )
  + Ending in the expected pattern for the data object (ex. AML.VER123.T1234 )
- Introduced a mitigation object schema for testing `object-type: "mitigation"` data, if exists
- Optional case study references, if exists, expected to be a list

#### Tools
- Updated output YAML generation script to accept arbitrary object types and output them as top-level keys.
  + Ex. `object-type: "mitigation"` produces the top-level key `mitigations:` in `ATLAS.yaml`
- Case study import script can replace existing case studies when provided files with an existing ID

## [3.0.0]() (2022-03-23)
